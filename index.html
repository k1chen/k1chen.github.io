          <p>
            Hi, I'm Kenneth! I'm currently a senior studying computer science at
            Boston College. My academic interests lie in web and mobile app
            development. Outside of school, I enjoy photography of all kinds,
            ranging from sports to portraiture and landscape. Please feel free
            to reach out to me by clicking either of the buttons under my
            profile!

          <p>
            This was a project built with D3.js and Vega-Lite for CSCI3311 Data
            Visualization. I was given a dataset from an examination done on the
            HCS EdConnect internet broadband initiative in the local community
            of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Users are able to utilize a brushable
            scatterplot in which each point in the scatterplot would represent a
            family in the dataset. The subsequent stacked bar chart below the
            scatterplot would adjust based on the brushed-upon points. Below
            that, a pie chart would also automatically adjust. The key takeaway
            from this project and its data was that there are indications of a
            broader disproportionate pattern of low-income statuses affecting
            families of color than not.

          <p>
            This was a project built with HTML, CSS and Tableau to visualize
            student enrollment in specific majors at Boston College. Data was
            sorted data on Tableau by year for the columns, filtered for the top
            five over the given years, and the enrollment count was as the rows.
            In addition, I redesigned Florence Nightingale's famous Coxcomb
            chart to better visualize the causes of mortality in the Army from
            April 1855 to March 1856.
